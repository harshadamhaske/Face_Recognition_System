Face Detection System – This web-based Face Detection System utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Face API.js to detect faces, recognize expressions, and estimate age and gender in real time. The system relies on pre-trained deep learning models within Face API.js for efficient facial analysis.

Tech Stack:
1) HTML & CSS: Provides structure and styling for the user interface.
2) JavaScript: Handles logic, real-time processing, and API integration.
3) Face API.js: Implements deep learning models for facial analysis.
   
Models Used in Face API.js:
1) SSD MobileNet V1 – A lightweight Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) optimized for fast face detection.
2) Tiny Face Detector – A smaller, faster model with lower computational cost, ideal for real-time applications.
3) Face Landmark Model – Detects 68 facial landmarks, such as eyes, nose, and jawline, useful for further face analysis.
4) Face Recognition Model – Compares facial features to recognize unique identities.
5) Expression Recognition Model – Classifies emotions like happy, sad, surprised, neutral, etc.
6) Age & Gender Estimation Model – Predicts approximate age and gender based on facial features.
